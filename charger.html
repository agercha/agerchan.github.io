A phone charger by the bed means a few things.
You thought about me when I was not there.
You want my life to be better and easier, for my phone not to die the next day.
Unless you were just annoyed when I asked you to put my phone on the charger on your side of the bed.
That’s possible. 
</p>

<p>
So you were thinking about me.
I wonder what that’s like.
What is your idea of me?
When you thought about me,
when you thought about me asking you to plug in my phone,
when you walked around the bed to set up a charger on my side
and thought about the next time I would come over,
what else did you think about?
</p>

<p>
You told me something along the lines of <em>at first</em>
you liked me because of my looks. 
This means that now you like me for other reasons too.
I try to guess what those reasons could be.
I’m not very interesting.
I want to do boring things like buy expensive smoothies and get my nails done.
I want to go to parties and turn my brain off and leave feeling okay
even if I didn’t meet anybody interesting.
I talk about things I don’t understand as if I understand them sometimes,
but usually stop talking and get quiet when they come up.
I don’t know how computers work, still, in the third year of my degree.
When I say hi to someone, I make sure to wave and look as happy as possible.
I am happy, and I make a point to show it.
I like to gossip.
I’m a little selfish sometimes, but I think everybody is.
I like to remember little things about people, and so I try hard to do that. 
Sometimes I don’t have the energy.

<p>
In seventh grade, a girl I had never spoken to before sent me a long confession of love
She told me that she can tell that I am special, 
that I am kind and always put others before myself. 
How did she know that? 
I don’t even think it’s true. 
Even if it is true, <em>how did she know that?</em>
</p>

<p>
When I left you alone with my best friend,
three seltzers and two vodka crans in, you just talked about me.
You talked to her about my paintings, 
which you must have seen when you were looking at my Instagram. 
You said they were beautiful and wondered how I wasn’t an art student. 
I don’t think you know enough about my paintings to say that, 
you think too highly of them. 
There’s not a lot to them at all. 
I started learning art because I was jealous of my best friend. 
My paintings are colorful because I don’t know how to mix the correct tones, 
so I use whatever is at hand. 
They are a lot like me. 
I try to make them look good, but I’m not sure what I want them to say.
</p>

<p>
There’s a little ceremony 
that goes along with you presenting me with the phone charger. 
I hand you my phone. You put on an act, <em>why are you giving me this?</em>
I have to say it out loud, <em>can you please put my phone on the charger?</em> 
You get to smile and point to the charger. 
You are telling me you thought of me. 
You are telling me to write about this. 
I do. 
I also get excited and exclaim something and I hug you. 
Is this how you imagine me usually? I don’t usually feel like this. 
</p>

<p>
I don’t know who I am to you, and I try not to think about it. 
Maybe I should. 
I am a girl with bangs and a smiley piercing, 
I am skinny, I speak Russian, and I am low maintenance. 
None of these things I earned. 
Maybe that really is all there is to me, and maybe nobody minds that. 
Easy to define, inoffensive, attractive. 
But I hope that’s not exactly what I am in your eyes. 
I’m hungry, I want to know what you <em>do</em> think of me. 
I can’t imagine it. 
I am a part of your life. Right? 
I am not only there, but you also want me there. 
Do you want me there? 
Maybe you get nervous to text me, and think about how I will react. 
Now I am imagining you imagining me reacting to you. 
There’s no way that happens. 
</p>

<p>
There has to be something more to me. 
At least in others’ eyes. 
It wouldn’t make sense otherwise, 
but I can’t,
for the life of me, 
figure out what it could be. 
</p>

<p>
In college, the boy I had dated for two years 
told me I was the one that got away. 
How? 
Why didn’t he tell me that when I was there? 
What do I offer? 
I don’t understand. 
</p>

<p>
I think what it comes down to 
is that I want somebody to write about the way they feel about me.
</p>

<p>
I’ve been absorbing a lot from those around me. 
I feel fulfilled. 
There’s things going on in the lives of those around me, 
backstories and histories. 
I don’t feel that way about myself, 
but I am fulfilled by food, laughing, and drinking. 
Also sitting in the sun. 
It makes me feel just close enough to a real person to not mind. 
</p>

<p>
I think it’s okay then. 
I contain enough to last two more weeks, 
and then you will pack up and move out and take the charger with you. 
I will spend my free time this summer sitting under the sun. 
Then I’ll go back to school. 
I’ll probably end up meeting more people 
that will see me and analyze me from the outside, like you did. 
But I still can’t imagine someone thinking about me, 
sitting in their own room, while I’m not there.
