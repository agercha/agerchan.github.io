        Yesterday I stumbled upon a photo an acquaintance of mine had posted. Something about it didn’t sit right with me. It was part of a painting, showing a woman’s torso, in a red dress, neckline, and arms. At the bottom, the artist and name of the painting were cited, as well as “detail”. That’s funny. I thought. These aren’t details. It’s everything but her face. They literally just chose to remove her face.

        Every time I write, I want to write about splitting oranges. I allow myself to overindulge in sentimentality, and I’m afraid that the topic of digital nostalgia deserves more nuance than I’ll be able to provide. I’d like to show the subtle ways the internet has affected me, and I’d like to do that without unnecessary words and without trailing off, but I know I won’t be able to stick to these good intentions. I hope I’m able to get my point across nonetheless, talking about what’s important while I’m talking about what’s beautiful.

        When I worked at a grocery store, I would always buy fruit with my lunch. I love fuji apples, for their sweetness, and plums for their bite. I love oranges, the summeriest color, for being winter fruit. Charlotte and I bought every citrus in the store and ranked them. Navel, heirloom, satsuma, pomello, grapefruit, blood orange, cara cara, kumquat, tangerine, mandarin. Laid out and half peeled on the table, they it really  reminded me of a renaissance painting, the kind that painters made to show off how realistic they could make them, and the kind people bought to show off the opulence of fruit. Kumquats are not good but they remind me of my sister, who would always steal them. Blood oranges are good, but cara caras taste better. An old man once bought five pounds of them, so I asked what the difference was, and he said they were his favorite and just told me to buy one. I’d always leave one out on the register while I worked. Offer a slice to all of my coworkers. Sometimes they haven’t tried cara cara oranges, I feel a huge sense of pride, telling them this big secret, inducting them into our club of cara cara lovers. It is the great equalizer.

        And, as I’m eating my slice, I’m thinking about this. I’m thinking of the terrible significance this has for the two of us. I’m back in my bedroom, sophomore year of high school, it’s 3am. I’m listening through the phone to Andrew breathing. He is I think. I’ve had to do this for the past few nights and, even though I wake up at 6:30, I reassure him that I’ll stay on as late long as he needs me to. We continue in near silence. My thoughts trail off for a second. Isn’t this kind of romantic? The sacrifice, the suffering. The shared silence between us. This is the moment that links the two of us.

        What is wrong with you???

        If he stops breathing I’m supposed to call 911 because he’s hurt himself.

        Not every moment has to be beautiful. This isn’t about you. In the morning, my dad informs me that I ran out of money on my plan again: the call ended up costing me a total of $6.50. Since then, the two of us have decided that calling and texting is important enough, and they are unlimited on my new plan. We also agreed that data was not a necessity, so I have a certain amount set each and have to pay extra if I go over my limit.

        The streetcar outside of the Trader Joes in New York (where the line was too long for us to stay) sold oranges and we bought two, after which we got on the subway to go to Central Park. We were going to have a picnic, the thought of which made us laugh because it was so quaint and, so absurd, but what did we go to New York for but for this. I pull up the transit app on my phone, because I know her phone is always about to die and because I like to think I understand directions better. Above ground, my phone reconnects to the network. My dad texted me that I’ve used a lot of excess data this trip. I make sure not to open the message and try to enjoy our picnic. We eat one of the oranges, and it gets all over our hands (of course we don’t have napkins). This is the juicer kind. A: a navel, a “California” orange. Something links me to this orange now. I take a photo of our hands with our halves of the fruit and you take a photo of me in my dress. I bought the dress at goodwill. I, and it’s a gorgeous emerald color and a marbled pattern, and I love how it fits. It was just a little too cold to wear it, but it’s ok;: I needed a picture in this dress. I don’t post very often, at least in my opinion, but I’d like to post these. As I’m looking through them, I’m disappointed. Again. How does my face ruin every photo? There’s nothing wrong specifically, but my hair doesn’t quite fall right, and the shape of the shadows seemsshadows are shaped a little bit off. Why do my eyes look old??

        “Would it be shallow to post the photo with my face cropped out? I just love how the dress looks.” She shakes your head. I open the photos in my editing app and kind of smile. My waist really does look so nice in the dress. I post one of the photos of myself and the photo of the oranges. It’s funny for me to think now that Instagram was using most of my data in New York, not transit or messages or maps. The entire trip to me seems so saturated in my favorite romantic feeling, this picnic, second hand book stores, sharing clothes, sleeping in the same bed. We had hit all the cliches. I can’t figure out when I have time to go on instagram if I held her hand the entire trip. I guess it was so beautiful I wanted people to see. Her mom calls her, so I stop to call my mom too, who is always nicer on the phone, at least nicer than I remember her being. It makes me feel a little better about going home soon.

        The next photo I posted I jokingly captioned the next photo I posted “Currently fighting the urge to crop my face out of every photo”. I was holding out my shirt, a white t-shirt with a semi-ironic graphic print (another goodwill find), looking very proud of myself. I made sure that the second slide on the post was just a close up of it. I laughed, remembering how similar it was to another caption I had used, some three years ago. T: the summer after Andrew moved away, I went on a trip with my childhood friend, and I captioned a photo she took of me “I can’t have my face and pose both look good in a photo, and I’m pretty sure this is neither”. To be completely honest, I thought it was one the best photos I had of myself at the time. It didn’t quite look like me; if I squinted, it could have been any other 15 year old. It was almost like it wasn’t me, like I was posting someone else to the world. A cute photo without any personal contextcontext of a person behind it.

        That same friend had also told me I should post more still lifes, that I you should alternate between photos of myyourself and other things. She took it upon herself to pose a cup of tea with a flower in it, a magazine, and some tulips, for my account. “Do you want this tea?” she asked after taking the photo. “I don’t actually drink it.”

        I’ve ended this less subtly than I thought I would. Although I really don’t want to beat a dead horse, I just want to know that I would like to know that my point didn’t get lost while I talked about citrus. 
        </p>

        I love it when things are beautiful, but, in the end, there’s so much that is more important. And that’s hard to get across in a picture.
