            My <em>Conversation Vareniki Lunch</em> is meant to invoke a joyful, childhood emotion, 
            and relish in the simple, unpretentious joy that you can get from 
            childish cliches.

            My <em>Conversation Vareniki Lunch</em> is an example of 
            relational aesthetics. It consists of the audience, 
            in this case my classmates, sitting on the ground around a short 
            table, eating a meal of conversation vareniki. 
            Vareniki are a traditional form of boiled Ukrainian dumplings, and 
            are traditionally savory or sweet. In <em>Conversation Vareniki Lunch</em>, 
            the vareniki are one of five flavors - potato, potato with 
            bacon and cheese, spinach and ricotta, sweet cheese, and cherry. 
            They are made to imitate the look of Valentine’s Day conversation 
            hearts, and each flavor is colored yellow, orange, green, purple, 
            and pink, in that order. All the vareniki have a quippy saying 
            written on them - most from genuine conversation hearts and some 
            similar humorous pop culture cliches. 
        </p>

            <!-- <img src="orange.png"  style="width:100px;float:right;margin:10px"> -->
            I serve the vareniki one by one for each audience member, 
            careful to choose something accurate and not hurtful (some vareniki 
            have sayings like “nope” or “bye”). I serve two courses, 
            savory first and then sweet. The critique is carried out during 
            the piece. As a supplement to the piece, I reserved two sets of 
            dumplings for a past and present love interest, which I will prepare 
            for them in a similar manner to the main piece.

            <em>Conversation Vareniki Lunch</em> invokes a childhood celebration 
            of Valentine’s day, along with the adult, intentful act of cooking 
            and caring for a loved one. The individual vareniki are notes 
            representing how I felt making them (on worse days I made “eww” 
            and “sorry” but on others I made “my 1” and “be my idol”). They are 
            intimate to me, as both literal expressions of my thoughts, but also 
            as expressions of my skills and effort as a cook. Sitting close 
            together and all ingesting these vareniki is intimate for the artist
            as the one being judged and as the audience as the one offering up 
            their bodies for this ingestion experiment. It lays out our 
            relationship, summarizing it in a short quippy phrase, still more 
            intimate and direct than it often is in an academic setting. I enjoy 
            the vulnerability of cooking and admitting to caring or even 
            thinking about someone, and the hope of <em>Conversation Vareniki Lunch</em> 
            is to force this joyful, childish honesty in our formalized art 
            critique space.
