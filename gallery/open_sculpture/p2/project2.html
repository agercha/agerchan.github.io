            <em>Soldat</em> is a recreation of <em>Monument to the Soldier Liberator</em>, a 
            World War II monument in Kharkiv - where my family is from - 
            celebrating the Soviet liberation of Ukraine from the Axis powers. 
            In the background plays a song by Verka Serduchka, a Ukrainian drag 
            queen mega pop star, famous in the 2000s throughout the Russian 
            speaking world; who in her whole career remained political and brash 
            in her discussion of the Soviet Union and any government she was 
            affected by. I started working on <em>Soldat</em> before Russia attacked 
            Ukraine, as a way of reconciling my interpretation of my parents’ 
            life and heritage, the Soviet Union, and my family’s present in 
            Ukraine.

            Like many other Soviet era monuments, the one <em>Soldat</em> is based on is 
            a reminder of the very real and intense pain and sacrifice 
            experienced in Ukraine during the war, but it is also inextricably 
            patriotic to the Soviet Union, celebrating the Red Army’s victory. 
            They are a reminder that Ukraine is permanently linked with its 
            Soviet past and its post Soviet neighbors. This relationship 
            continued to change in the 2000’s, with a cultural shift from the 
            conservatism and traditionalism of the Soviet Union. Verka Serduchka 
            emerged as a Russian speaking pop star. Her very existence as a 
            gender non conforming artist in this area was political, but she 
            continued to push boundaries singing in Ukrainian while wearing 
            traditional outfits, as well as subverting military and Stalinist 
            imagery in her silver uniform inspired costumes. Despite this, she 
            attained incredible success within Ukraine and outside of it, until 
            she was banned from performing in Russia after her 2007 Eurovision 
            performance of “Dancing Lasha Tumbai”, which sounds too much like 
            “Russia Goodbye” to Putin’s liking.

            It has been difficult for me to reconcile the difference between the 
            country my parents left in 1999 and what it is now. My parents left 
            the country in its infancy, as it was still building a modern 
            national identity, and raised me in the Soviet way they were raised. 
            I think I’ve always had a sense of belonging to a country that I 
            would never visit and no longer existed. The idea of WWII was almost 
            religious to us. When I visited Ukraine, monuments commemorating the 
            war were omnipresent like gods, I read its history like a holy text, 
            and visited burial sites like a space of silent worship. At the same 
            time, Verka Seduchka’s music played in my home my whole life, a 
            natural presence I never questioned and whose political nature I 
            didn’t appreciate until much later. I began working on <em>Soldat</em> before 
            the recent invasion began. I believe the monument in Kharkiv is 
            still standing. My family is alive, but I can’t say that they are 
            safe. I’m not sure what I can say about Ukrainians’, past and 
            present, relationship with the country's past. I have, however, 
            found comfort in listening to Verka Serduchka sing about times that 
            have now passed.

            <em>Soldat</em> was also shown as part of an exhibition at 
            <em>The Frame</em> gallery, as seen below.
