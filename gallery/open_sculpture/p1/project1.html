            For my first project, I wanted to explore the process of food 
            preparation. My project was to consist of a set of paintings of 
            dishes I prepared, where I gave myself as much time for each 
            painting as it took to prepare the dish itself. These dishes include 
            apples, vegetable soup, burritos, an omelet, tea, salmon and rice, 
            and cookies. Originally, I planned to display these paintings as 
            either a book or on the wall. However, I ended up setting up a 
            dinner table plating using these paintings. This consists of my 
            actual dinner table and chair, and the paintings served in pots, 
            pans, and plates, also from my kitchen. The table is finished with 
            cut up cucumbers, in individual cups on the cutting board.

            This project is meant to explore food, the process of making it, and 
            what it means to me. My relationship with food has varied over the 
            years but, currently, it isn’t something I make time for. I have 
            always associated cooking with my mom, my family, help, personal 
            relationships, and self care. It grounds me - it is making something 
            real and undeniable, something that not only do you and your loved 
            ones want, but it is something you need. Nonetheless, I have found 
            it difficult to leave time to prepare food so I wanted to use this 
            project as a reason to give myself permission to spend that time 
            doing something I want and need. The recreation of these dishes 
            gives me that time again - I am required to spend this time 
            painting. I have a different relationship with painting - it is not 
            as “required” as cooking, and it is fully independent - I do it only 
            for myself and not to feed those around me. Taking this time for 
            myself is not only an act of self care, but also time for forced 
            reflection, making me think about time, how I allocate it, and how 
            it makes me feel.

            The subject matter is mundane and also personal, so the method of 
            display is the same way. I used my genuine belongings to provide a 
            snapshot of how I live. Just as I have thoughts and memories 
            associated with any of the foods I prepared, so do I with the 
            kitchen utensils and furniture. I spent the better part of a year 
            working through my 60 hour school weeks at this table and the pans 
            are a mixture of found, gifted, and inherited - from people I love 
            and from people I do not know. The cut up cucumbers are important to 
            me in two ways. As a child, it was a staple side with my dinner. 
            Today, I spend 10 minutes a few times a week cutting up cucumbers 
            for me and my housemate to share. Hopefully sharing these cucumbers 
            with the rest of the class will create another memory and moment of
            significance, not private, but personal.

            For research, I looked into multiple other artworks heavily 
            featuring food and diet. Mostly, I was interested in Sophie Calle’s 
            “The Chromatic Diet”. I felt like it was so interesting to see an 
            artwork consisting of preparing food and the documentation of it. 
            Professor Ginger Brooks Takahashi also did refer to 
            “The Dinner Party” when suggesting I switch to a table setting, 
            rather than a traditional 2-d display method. Although very 
            different in subject matter, I did feel like the ritualistic dinner 
            table setting reminded me in some way of the process of cooking and 
            the setting of my table. On a different note, another piece I 
            realize undoubtedly influenced this project was Salt, Fat, Acid, 
            Heat by Samin Nosrat. When I read this book in high school, it was 
            pivotal in my relationship with food. It helped me understand food 
            as a craft, as something that you enjoy, as something you do out of 
            love for others and yourself.

            Working on this project, I realized that the idea of spending time 
            on something is only part of the story. In order to feel like I 
            actually was creating something, I had to put myself in a specific 
            mindset. It didn’t end up feeling peaceful just because I cooked - I 
            only felt peaceful and rewarded when I was making food I enjoyed or 
            making food for others. Another part I didn’t anticipate was the 
            quick paintings - those that depicted quick dishes. With barely 
            enough time to put in on paper, much less plan the best size and
            setup, plates like apples or tea felt strange. When it came to 
            preparing the foods, however, it was the opposite - the tea and 
            apples genuinely felt more calming to prepare and I honestly felt 
            more connected to myself in those moments. In the end, assembling it 
            all felt strange, like putting on a show. It was unusual putting 
            what I made on display - especially if I wasn’t happy with it. In 
            all honesty, the part that I felt the most connected to was choosing 
            the kitchenware - it felt very calming and intimate choosing which 
            plates and pans I wanted to bring, and how I wanted to display the 
            food. What I was left thinking was that I wish I wasn’t constrained, 
            that I had had more time: more time to make more food, more time to 
            paint.
